                  Marina Center is located between kilometer 94 - kilometer 105
                  north of the coastal road Alexandria Matrouh and has been
                  fully constructed. Marina Center is located in one of the best
                  costal locations as it has to its west and the city of
                  Al-Alamal, after which there is the famous area of Sidi Abd
                  al-Rahman. The area between 98.5 km and 100 km has been fully
                  delivered to the Egyptian Antiquities Authority as some Roman
                  relics was found there and currently excavations are under way
                  with care in the hope of exploring the ruins of this ancient
                  city, which is said to have already been the Roman port, which
                  exported wheat and grapes to the entire northern coast.
                  <br></br>
                  Marina Center is an integrated tourism project that takes its
                  right path to exploitation and investment through a clear
                  vision and sound guidance in the stages of planning, design,
                  implementation, management, operation, marketing, promotion
                  and revitalization, and the idea of establishing this center
                  aims to install Egyptian and foreign feet on the road of beach
                  tourism and entertainment to the global level<br></br>
                  This resort has been given the term &apos;center&apos; because
                  it is considered the largest touristic gathering located on
                  the northwest coast and exceeds the term &apos;village&apos;
                  and has been called &apos;marina&apos;, which is opposite the
                  word &apos;Marine&apos;, which means port as it is said and
                  mentioned earlier that this area was already the Romanian port
                  for the export of agricultural products to Rome
